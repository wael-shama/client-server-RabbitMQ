This Go-based client-server system implements an ordered map data structure with O(1) operations using a hybrid hash map and doubly-linked list design, where clients send commands (addItem, deleteItem, getItem, getAllItems) to a RabbitMQ queue that the server processes concurrently using goroutines, with thread-safe logging to separate files for output. 

To test, run `god mod tidy` first, then start the services with `docker-compose up -d` (if you have docker installed), then run `docker-compose run client -file /commands.txt` using a sample commands file (or interactively), verify command processing in server logs (docker-compose logs server). 

check output in server-logs/getItem.log and server-logs/getAllItems.log, and monitor RabbitMQ at `http://localhost:15672` (``guest/guest``) to observe queue operations and message flow.
